.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This is a commandline tool for the digital Lab Brick attenuator from Vaunix\&. It
allows you to control multiple device and set attenuation individually for each"
attenuator\&.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\-h
.RS 4
Prints a list of usable commands\&.
.RE
.PP
\-a
\<\fIattenuation in dB\fR\>
.RS 4
This Option allows sets the attenuation to the given dB value\&.
.sp
The attenuation
can be set in \&.25dB value\&. Even if the attenuator does not have a
\fIresolution\fR of \&.25dB it will accept the value and set it internally to
the next lower resolution step\&.
.sp
If the chosen attenuation is above the maximal attenuation supported
a warning will be prompted and the attenuation will be set to
the highest possible value\&.
.sp
If the chosen attenuation is below the minimal attenuation the attenuation
will be set to the lowest possible value\&.
.RE
.PP
\-end
\<\fIattenuation in dB\fR\>
.RS 4
Set attenuation end point for \fIramp\fR or \fItriangle\fR form\&.
.sp
The attenuation
can be set in \&.25dB value\&. Even if the attenuator does not have a
\fIresolution\fR of \&.25dB it will accept the value and set it internally to
the next lower resolution step\&.
.sp
If the chosen attenuation is above the maximal attenuation supported
a warning will be prompted and the attenuation will be set to
the highest possible value\&.
.sp
If the chosen attenuation is below the minimal attenuation the attenuation
will be set to the lowest possible value\&.
.RE
.PP
\-f
\<\fI/path/to/file\fR\>
.RS 4
Use a \&.csv file to set attenaution values\&. The file should have the syntax
.RS 4
\<\fItime\fR\>,\<\fIattenuation in dB\fR\>
.RE
.sp
To set an attenuation of 4\&.5dB for a time of 6 seconds followed by 3
seconds at 10dB the lines would look like:
.RS 4
.sp
6,4\&.5
.sp
3,10
.RE
.sp
The attenuation
can be set in \&.25dB value\&. Even if the attenuator does not have a
\fIresolution\fR of \&.25dB it will accept the value and set it internally to
the next lower resolution step\&.
.sp
If the chosen attenuation is above the maximal attenuation supported
a warning will be prompted and the attenuation will be set to
the highest possible value\&.
.sp
If the chosen attenuation is below the minimal attenuation the attenuation
will be set to the lowest possible value\&.
.RE
.PP
\-i
.RS 4
This options prints additional information about connected attenuator devices\&.
.RE
.PP
\-l
\<\fI/path/to/file\fR\>
.RS 4
Log attenuation steps with time stamp to a file\&.
.RE
.PP
\-md
\<\fI/path/to/file1\fR\> \<\fI/path/to/file2\fR\>
.RS 4
This option enables multiple devices with (different) files to be used\&.
It will try to match each given file to an attenuator\&. If there are more
files then attenuator detected the first \fIn\fR files will be used, where
\fIn\fR is the number of attenuators detected\&.
.sp
If there are more attenuators detected, than files provided the program will
only use as many attenuators as files are given\&.
.sp
The attenuation
can be set in \&.25dB value\&. Even if the attenuator does not have a
\fIresolution\fR of \&.25dB it will accept the value and set it internally to
the next lower resolution step\&.
.sp
If the chosen attenuation is above the maximal attenuation supported
a warning will be prompted and the attenuation will be set to
the highest possible value\&.
.sp
If the chosen attenuation is below the minimal attenuation the attenuation
will be set to the lowest possible value\&.
.RE
.PP
\-q
.RS 4
This option disables the [INFO] output. [ERROR] and [WARN] will be shown\&.
.RE
.PP
\-r
.BS 4
If this option is enabled the program will repeat the command until cnaceled
by the user\&.
.RE
.PP
\-rr
\<\fInumber of reruns\fR\>
.RS 4
If this option is enabled the program will repeat its command for a number
of times\&.
.RE
.PP
\-ramp
.RS 4
Set attenuation in form of a ramp using \fI\-start\fR and \fI\-end\fR to specify
the maximal and minimal attenuation\&. This option excludes \fI\-triangle\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-start
\<\fIattenuation in dB\fR\>
.RS 4
This option sets the attenuation start point for \fI\-ramp\fR or \fI\-traingle\fR
.sp
The attenuation
can be set in \&.25dB value\&. Even if the attenuator does not have a
\fIresolution\fR of \&.25dB it will accept the value and set it internally to
the next lower resolution step\&.
.sp
If the chosen attenuation is above the maximal attenuation supported
a warning will be prompted and the attenuation will be set to
the highest possible value\&.
.sp
If the chosen attenuation is below the minimal attenuation the attenuation
will be set to the lowest possible value\&.
.RE
.PP
\-step
\<\fIattenuation in dB\fR\>
.RS 4
This option defines the change in attenuation for the \fI\-ramp\fR and
\fI\-trianlge\fR option\&. If no step size is defined \&.25dB will be used\&.
.sp
The attenuation
can be set in \&.25dB value\&. Even if the attenuator does not have a
\fIresolution\fR of \&.25dB it will accept the value and set it internally to
the next lower resolution step\&.
.sp
If the chosen attenuation is above the maximal attenuation supported
a warning will be prompted and the attenuation will be set to
the highest possible value\&.
.RE
.PP
\-t 
\<\fItime\fR\> \<\fItime unit\fR\>
.RS 4
keep the attenuation for a given amount of time
in s\|ms\|us\&.
.sp
If nothing is specified one second is the standard time and unit set\&.
If only the time is set, seconds will be used as time unit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-triangle
.RS 4
Set attenuation in the form of a triangle using \fI\-start\fR and \fI\-end\fR
to specify the maximal and minimal attenuation\&. This option excludes
\fI\-ramp\fR\&.
